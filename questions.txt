So, we need to have a tensor with constant dimensions as an input,
based on the restrictions of Theano... i.e. we actually have docs
and summaries with different lengths. When we pad the matrices 
that represent the documents, what should the padding vector look like?
Does it have its own token, or should it simply be a column of zeros?

Sparse tensor representations... currently have to use a dense matrix
as an input since there is no 3-tensor sparse representation...
